        <p align="center">happy anniversary my lovely gummy wummy! welcome to the letter and end of this website! i started this project on february 
            <br>24th, but took a break from it and continued it on march 14th! so it only really took me a few days :0 pretty impressive right!
            <br>i don't know anything about code, so it's a little scuffed but it's the thought that counts u_u i hope it was at least enjoyable to
            <br>go through the website c:
            <br>
            <br>can you believe it's been 2 years already?! it sounds long, but at the same time it's felt so short! but then at the same time i feel
            <br>like i've known you for way longer. my life with you have been filled with so much joy and fun first times! i think finding you was  
            <br>truly one of the best things that's happened to me c: i love you very very much :3 i'm so grateful that i'm able to do so many fun 
            <br>things with the person i love most! everyday i look foward to talking to you and at this point, you've become a part of my everyday
            <br>routine. i love all the time that we get to spend together, whether it's playing games (last epoch at da moment), or going on silly
            <br>food dates! recently i've been especially enjoying our cooking dates and gaming nights :3 i hope that you know that you truly make
            <br>me the happiest girly alive! i wish i could've gotten you more stuff, but i didn't really know what to get you!! i decided to make you
            <br>a little candy basket because i thought about it, and surprisingly i've never given you a candy basket before and i think that it is a
            <br> must! and then i got u a new razor that you needed, i found this chrome edition one and it's cool and shiny and i think you would enjoy 
            <br>it. and den last but not least, i made a bento! i hope the portion size is enough, that was what a was most worried about because the
            <br>bentos that i see online always have the smallest portion size ever. i don't think anybody can be full with those tiny bentos!! i made
            <br>a rolled omlette, mini sausage octopi (although they just look like normal mini sausages if you don't look closely), spam masubi, and 
            <br>spam onigiri! i made these the day before and then i'm gonna do all the rice components on the day of so that the rice isn't all weird.
            <br>i dunno what else to say i accidently let out all my feelings in your birthday letter when i probably should've saved them for this letter
            <br>O_O anyways ya dis is the end i hope you liked my little silly website, i still have to figure out how to um make it into an actual website
            <br>because right now it's still just a file that only i can open up on my puter or something idk lul. i wanna show you the code too, but it's
            <br> on my big ole puter, so maybe when you come over one day, remind me to show you the code if you wanna see it :3
